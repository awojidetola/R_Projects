## Vectors, Matrices and Dataframes in R

```{r}

age <- c(32, 26, 98, 24)
age[1]
age[c(2,3)]
names(age) <- c("Joy", "Dotun","Eliza","Soweto")
age[c("Soweto","Dotun")]
mean(age)
sd(age)
sum(age)
```

```{r}
mat1 <- matrix(5:13, nrow=3, byrow=TRUE)
colnames(mat1) <- c("First", "Second","Third")
rownames(mat1) <- c("1", "2","3")
mat1
```
